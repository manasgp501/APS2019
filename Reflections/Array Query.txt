Array Query Problem
1) Lookup table Technique
    Space Complexity : O(n^2)
    Time Complexity : O(n^2)
    Created by taking min. no. b/w two indices.
    Useful in the case when there are more no. of queries.
2) Square Root Decomposition
    Divide the array in sqrt(n) blocks.
    Technique is calculating the min. in blockas and using it for query.
    Space Complexity : O(n)
    Time Complexity : sqrt(n)
3) Segment Tree
    Created by dividing the array into two halves and storing the halves sum in node until we get the array lements at node.
    Time Complexity : O(log(n))
    Used whn size of data and data is static.
