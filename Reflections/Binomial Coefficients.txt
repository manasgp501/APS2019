Binomial Coefficient
Binomial Coefficient is used to fint the coefficient with a given n and k. There are 3 ways, all having time complexity ofO(n*k).
1) Recursive Version
   C(n,k)=C(n-1,k-1)+C(n-1,k)
   The memory occupied is 2^(n-1)*(memory required for last recursive call).
   Best ehen there is only one single query.
2) 1-D Dynamic Version
   The size occupied is less compared to Recursive Version as same set copy isn't created everytime.
   Uses values from previous row of Pascal's triangle and best when we need to generate Binomial Coefficients for a row.
3) 2-D Dynamic Version
   Best when multiple queries are to be made.
